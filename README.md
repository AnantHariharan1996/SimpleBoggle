# SimpleBoggle
This is a simple package that can generate and 'solve' a boggle board of any dimensions. Solving takes under a minute- just enough time for you to leave this package running in the background while you tally you and your friends' scores up! All solutions are based on the 2019 Scrabble Dictionary- if you hate some of the words it spits out, blame the scrabble guys. 

Currently, the code solves for words of 3 or more letters. 



*Future Improvements*:

A massive issue with this version is that this code will not work if your board has a 'Qu' tile. 
This will be fixed in a future release.
